# FocusMode

### ðŸš§ Work in Progress ðŸš§

An Android App for helping increase focus and productivity during heavy workdays or when required.

As the use of smartphones is increasing day by day, we as a normal human being very often use our smartphones to a very unhealthy amount and unfortunately often fail to do things which should be given a higher priority. We might have exams and/or other important things to do and even if we want to do those things, we keep our phones aside for quick Googling and end up wasting our time more than we imagined. The idea here is to provide an app that only allows a few basic apps to be used and restricts the use of others. Sound familiar? I came up with this exciting solution to a problem a lot of people might relate to a few months back. But ironically, a month later Google added this as a feature to it's Digital Wellbeing app with even the same name. Why am I still talking about it? Because all the smartphones that will be left behind with no android 10 updates and their OEM not supporting it won't get access to this amazing feature.

Idea:

  â€¢	When Focus Mode turned on, the app will work similar to an android launcher and only allow the use of basic apps such as dialer, calculator, etc.
  
  â€¢	It's UI will look somewhat like Ultra Power Saving Mode provided by some OEMs.
  
  â€¢	The user will be able to select apps that aren't a distraction for him/her and will be able to use them.
  
  â€¢	The user will be able to set a timer for other apps for up to an hour if he/she needs to use some of the other apps throughout the day.
